Additional Definitions. &#xa;&#xa;  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser&#xa;General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU&#xa;General Public License.&#xa;&#xa;  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,&#xa;other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&#xa;&#xa;  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided&#xa;by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.&#xa;Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode&#xa;of using an interface provided by the Library.&#xa;&#xa;  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an&#xa;Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library&#xa;with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked&#xa;Version&quot;.&#xa;&#xa;  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#xa;Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code&#xa;for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are&#xa;based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&#xa;&#xa;  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#xa;object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data&#xa;and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the&#xa;Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&#xa;&#xa;  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#xa;&#xa;  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License&#xa;without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#xa;&#xa;  2. Conveying Modified Versions.&#xa;&#xa;  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a&#xa;facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application&#xa;that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the&#xa;facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified&#xa;version:&#xa;&#xa;   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to&#xa;   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the&#xa;   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs&#xa;   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&#xa;&#xa;   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of&#xa;   this License applicable to that copy.&#xa;&#xa;  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&#xa;&#xa;  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from&#xa;a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object&#xa;code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated&#xa;material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure&#xa;layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates&#xa;(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&#xa;&#xa;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the&#xa;   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xa;   covered by this License.&#xa;&#xa;   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#xa;   document.&#xa;&#xa;  4. Combined Works.&#xa;&#xa;  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,&#xa;taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the&#xa;portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse&#xa;engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of&#xa;the following:&#xa;&#xa;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that&#xa;   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xa;   covered by this License.&#xa;&#xa;   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#xa;   document.&#xa;&#xa;   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during&#xa;   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among&#xa;   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the&#xa;   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#xa;&#xa;   d) Do one of the following:&#xa;&#xa;       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this&#xa;       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form&#xa;       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to&#xa;       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of&#xa;       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the&#xa;       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying&#xa;       Corresponding Source.&#xa;&#xa;       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xa;       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time&#xa;       a copy of the Library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xa;       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version&#xa;       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked&#xa;       Version. &#xa;&#xa;   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise&#xa;   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the&#xa;   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is&#xa;   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the&#xa;   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the&#xa;   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If&#xa;   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany&#xa;   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application&#xa;   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation&#xa;   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL&#xa;   for conveying Corresponding Source.)&#xa;&#xa;  5. Combined Libraries.&#xa;&#xa;  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xa;Library side by side in a single library together with other library&#xa;facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this&#xa;License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your&#xa;choice, if you do both of the following:&#xa;&#xa;   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based&#xa;   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,&#xa;   conveyed under the terms of this License.&#xa;&#xa;   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it&#xa;   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the&#xa;   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xa;&#xa;  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&#xa;&#xa;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#xa;of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new&#xa;versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may&#xa;differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xa;&#xa;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xa;Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version&#xa;of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;&#xa;applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and&#xa;conditions either of that published version or of any later version&#xa;published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you&#xa;received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser&#xa;General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser&#xa;General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#xa;&#xa;  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide&#xa;whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall&#xa;apply, that proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance of any version is&#xa;permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the&#xa;Library."/>
